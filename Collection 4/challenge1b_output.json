It does not tell us, however, how fast the reaction proceeds and whether under a particular reaction condition, the reaction can proceed to the equilibrium state. Answers to these questions are left to chemical kinetics. This is the topic of the current lecture. 3.1. Chemical Reaction Rate 3.1.1 Global Versus Elementary Reactions So far all reactions we have discussed are called global reactions. These reactions described an overall process by which reactants are converted to anticipated products at the end of the process. They do not describe the actual physical process. Take, for example, the simple reaction of hydrogen oxidation:",

First, the reactant molecules will have to physically collide with each other for the reaction to take place. Second the reaction must be reversible. There are only a few types of reactions that satisfy these criteria. The first type of elementary reactions is known as the unimolecular reaction, which involves only one reactant: A → products. (3.1) Examples include bond breaking reactions and isomerization reactions. As we will learn later, a unimolecular reaction actually requires collision so the first criterion is not violated. The rate of the above reaction is proportional to the molar concentration of A, i.e.,",
